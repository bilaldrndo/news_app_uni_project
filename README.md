## Some of the UX Principles applied
1. Different Fonts - We made sure that the font in the Details Screen is easy to read for a longer period of time. That is why we have decided to use “Georgia” as a font since it resembles a serif/sans-serif typeface, since it is scientifically proven that they cause less strain on the eye for prolonged reading time.
2. Usability - We made sure to select two primary colors that can be easily differentiated and seen by people who have eyesight problems like colour- blindness and so on..
3. Contrast - We made sure that there is enough contrast between elements that is listed on top of each other or side by side by choosing different colors with different contrasts as well as thin line spacers in tight spots.
4. “Less is more” / Aesthetic and minimalist design - We simplified the design as much as possible and avoided adding features that are not gonna be used by 95% of users in order to achieve design cleanliness as well as stick to the minimalistic principles.
5. Visual Hierarchy - We have stacked news elements in such a way where the most relevant news information is shown first followed by less related and important information. We have also decided to use different sizes of news cards in order to differentiate the most important news article from the less relevant ones.
6. Storytelling - We have implemented an onboarding process in our mobile app where upon the first entrance, the user will be guided through a small description of the app and all of the unique features that it has.
7. Familiarity - We decided to mimic design of other popular news websites in order to reduce the learning curve of users and make them feel at home upon the first meet with the product.
8. 3 clicks - Every single action that is available on our product can be done in 3 clicks or less.
9. Lean Startup Methodology - This is the first prototype of the product and that is why we have decided to make is as simple and easy to use as well as stayed away from more complex UI elements like shadows and fancy animations since they make the design less reusable and require more time to design.
10. User control and freedom - Users can cancel every action and simply return to any previous page/action that was presented to them.
11. Visibility of system status - We decided to use Loading Indicators when paginating and adding new news to the page since they notify users that there is progress in the background.
12. Error Prevention - We have decided to only provide Social Login Methods for users since it is easier for them to login that way and it also doesn’t require from them to make yet another account for another platform. Also, Facebook and Google Accounts are usually saved on User devices and don’t require frequent re authentication when using them.
13. Visibility of system status - We have decided to add a small Social Media logo next to users profile picture in order to remind them what Social Media they used when Sign In/Up to the app in order to reduct account losses.
14. Help and documentation - We have added a Help button/section on both Web and Mobile versions so that if users need any help or have any questions, they can easily find the solution or contact support.
